/**
 * Host broker for the sandbox duplex channel.
 *
 * The broker owns the host end of one persistent duplex channel to the sandbox
 * gateway. It reads request frames from the channel, forwards each one on the
 * existing Paperclip API path, and writes one response frame back. It sends a
 * heartbeat frame on an interval to prove liveness.
 *
 * The broker does not hold the route allowlist, the token replacement, or the
 * run attribution. The caller passes a forward handler, and the broker calls it
 * for each request. The handler applies the real token and the signed run
 * identifier, so those rules stay in one place on the existing forward path.
 *
 * The broker runs a set of nested timeout budgets:
 *   - forward budget: the deadline for one forward call.
 *   - response budget: the deadline for the broker to send one response frame.
 *   - gateway wait budget: the deadline the in-sandbox gateway waits for the
 *     response frame.
 * Each inner budget is smaller than its outer budget, so the broker aborts and
 * answers before the gateway gives up. The broker asserts this order at
 * construction and fails a configuration that breaks it.
 *
 * The provider controls the duplex transport directly, so the broker treats each
 * request frame as untrusted. The broker bounds the work one channel can force:
 *   - in-flight limit: the maximum number of pending forwards at one time. It
 *     bounds the controllers, the timers, and the concurrent authenticated
 *     forwards.
 *   - lifetime limit: the maximum number of distinct requests over the channel
 *     lifetime. It bounds the retained request-id memory, because the broker keeps
 *     one id per distinct dispatched request for the no-replay guarantee.
 * The broker checks each limit before it adds the id to the seen set, allocates
 * the pending record, or calls the forward handler. On a limit it answers the
 * refused request with one bounded terminal response and forwards nothing. The
 * refusal preserves the no-replay and no-double-dispatch rules.
 *
 * Loss is terminal. The broker detects loss through channel exit, a stream
 * write failure, a protocol failure, a heartbeat write failure, and a close
 * timeout. On loss the broker stops the heartbeat, aborts every in-flight
 * forward, records the loss, and dispatches nothing more. The broker never
 * reconnects and never replays a request. The broker records the loss for
 * metrics only and sends nothing about the loss to the sandbox.
