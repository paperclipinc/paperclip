// Regression guard for advice a hosted user cannot act on.

// The probe used to answer a missing credential with "run `codex login` for the
// same OS user that runs the Paperclip server". On a self-hosted install that is
// fine: the host is the user's own machine. On a hosted multi-tenant install it
// is a dead end, and a customer who picked Codex expecting his ChatGPT plan to
// work followed that hint until he gave up and asked for a refund.
//
// The subtler half is credential *reporting*. Readiness falls back to
// `codexHomeHasUsableAuth(sharedSourceHome)`, i.e. the server's own Codex home.
// On a hosted install that credential belongs to the operator or another
// tenant, so a tenant could be told they were authenticated by someone else's
// login. The hosted branch therefore sits above every host-derived signal.
//
// `callerControlsHost: false` is how the server says "this person is a tenant,
// not the operator". These tests pin both directions.
